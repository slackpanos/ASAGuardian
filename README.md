ASAGuardian is a specialized tool designed to ensure the security and integrity of Cisco ASA firewalls. This Python-based application remotely connects to Cisco ASA devices via SSH to perform automated integrity checks. It verifies that the operating system and configuration settings have not been tampered with by comparing the current md5 checksums of these components against known good values.

**Key Features:**

+ Remote Integrity Verification: Securely connects to Cisco ASA firewalls and retrieves current state data to ensure system integrity.

+ MD5 Checksum Comparison: Uses cryptographic hash functions to compare the current state of the firewallâ€™s OS and configurations against predefined, trusted checksums.

+ Automated Security Audits: Allows network administrators to schedule regular integrity checks, ensuring continuous protection against unauthorized changes.

+ Detailed Reporting: Provides comprehensive logs and alerts for any discrepancies found during the integrity checks, aiding in quick response and remediation.

**Purpose**

ASAGuardian aims to provide network administrators and security professionals with a reliable tool to preemptively detect and respond to potential compromises in firewall integrity, thereby maintaining the security posture of their network environments.

**Prerequisites:**

+ Python 3.x

+ SSH access to the Cisco ASA firewalls that will be monitored

+ Optional: SSH private key if using key-based authentication
